[**ü¶å Antelapp**](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif/antelapp) is an app development kit made by [M Haidar Hanif](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif).

Visit the main demo at [antelapp.com](https://antelapp.com)

Use Turborepo, React, Remix, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, MySQL on PlanetScale, Docker, Vercel, and more. Bring the others from the JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js ecosystems.

The goal is to be more prepared when [building real-world apps and ideas](guides/IDEAS.md), ship things fast, also scale the project easily with many moving parts.

This is a highly opinionated collection of software engineering and web development workflow, monorepo project structure, ready-to-use interactive UI components, feature hooks, and various utilities.

If need something simpler without Turborepo, check out [Rewinds](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com).
